They seem to place the player in something like a dream<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a>, owing to their player-performative nature; mutable narrative and potentially massive scenario-space; increasingly compelling fidelity to our visual world; as well as their synergy with immersive VR. These dreams, or nightmares according to one’s preference, perhaps may help us more clearly see the phenomenological, governance, and ethical issues of a world of uploads, AGI, and ‘mind theft’.</div></div>
<div data-v-fb2bae8a data-v-10799180><div data-v-fb2bae8a class="relative max-w-xl mx-auto mb-6">In a more sinister vein, this essay proposes videogames, and the game engine (see below), as something akin to Giorgio Agamben’s apparatus <span class="citation annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner" data-cites="AGAMBEN_2009" data-tippy-content="<p>Agamben 2009</p>">&bull;</span> or a <em>dispositif</em> in Michel Foucault’s terminology, particularly as these concepts get picked up in Benjamin Bratton’s writing <span class="citation annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner" data-cites="BRATTON_2015" data-tippy-content="<p>Bratton 2015, pp. 161, 271-274</p>">&bull;</span><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a>.</div></div>

That we live in a world increasingly gamified<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> seems obvious: from riders on public transport compulsively shifting coloured tiles on an over-sized smartphone; personal fitness devices that award points for exercise; foreign language instruction from a chirpy green owl on Duolingo; access to (fairly sophisticated and often risky) options markets via a game-like interface on the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-11-05/playing-the-game-of-infinite-leverage">Robinhood</a> trading app.</div></div>

Similarly, the architecture of game engines is well covered in the technical literature, for instance: <a href="https://www.gameenginebook.com/urls.html">here</a>, or <a href="https://www.gamedev.net/articles/programming/general-and-gameplay-programming/making-a-game-engine-core-design-principles-r3210/">here</a>. However, some broad features are outlined, taking as a concrete example the <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/">Unreal Engine</a> platform, made by <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/home">Epic Games</a> (i.e. Fortnite), whose CEO Tim Sweeney is a leading proponent of a gaming-centred <a href="https://www.matthewball.vc/all/themetaverse">Metaverse</a> (one definition of 'Metaverse': an ecosystem of immersive 3D simulated environments that bleed ubiquitously into the 'real' world; the term also includes the infrastructure - software and massive distributed compute - that allow multiple companies and platforms to deliver this content-rich world, thereby correcting the flaws of today's Internet: corporate oligopoly and balkanised standards).</div></div>
<div data-v-fb2bae8a data-v-10799180><div data-v-fb2bae8a class="relative max-w-xl mx-auto mb-6">The game engine, narrowly defined, is the software in which the game is written and ultimately what drives the possibilities of the game, the computer/device platforms it can run on, and how it is finally distributed to consumers. More abstractly, it can be viewed as a ‘stack’ of software<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a>, in the sense developed by Benjamin Bratton which emphasises a relevance to spatio-political concerns, through and <em>contra</em> the geo-political writings of Carl Schmitt <span class="citation annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner" data-cites="BRATTON_2015" data-tippy-content="<p>Bratton 2015</p>">&bull;</span> . Specifically, it can be argued that elements of this Stack metaphor are applicable to the game engine<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a>, owing to physical interfaces with the world and our built environment. Although games are typically written on general-purpose computers, they are deployed on a range of computing platforms: dedicated consoles (Playstation, Xbox), smartphones, virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR) devices, servers, and desktop computers.</div></div>

Many of these companies also place AI/ML at the core of their businesses, and operate as entities with significant network benefits while generating, in some cases, negative social externalities. Lastly, explicitly or implicitly, through data harvesting, surveillance is often central to how they create value, as <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/02/02/shoshana-zuboff-age-of-surveillance-capitalism/">Shoshana Zuboff</a> has convincingly detailed.

<div data-v-fb2bae8a data-v-10799180><div data-v-fb2bae8a class="relative max-w-xl mx-auto mb-6">The profiles above of industry leaders in game development is illuminating in light of Bostrom’s point that major advances in WBE/AGI are likely to come from well-capitalised entities, and likely, once major developmental milestones have been hit, the successful pioneers in WBE are likely to pull ahead of competition at an accelerating pace <span class="citation annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner" data-cites="BOSTROM_2017" data-tippy-content="<p>Bostrom 2017, pp. 197-224, 107-108</p>">&bull;</span>. The reasons are clear: the enormous investment required to successfully emulate a human brain at a neuronal level, the processing power to maintaining one or more uploads; or else, the scale and sophistication of research platform required to create fundamental algorithmic advances that seem necessary to make AGI happen.</div></div>

<div data-v-fb2bae8a data-v-10799180><div data-v-fb2bae8a class="relative max-w-xl mx-auto mb-6">In <span class="citation annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner" data-cites="BOSTROM_SIM" data-tippy-content="<p>Bostrom 2003</p>">&bull;</span>, Nick Bostrom conducts a thought-experiment to assess the probability that we (currently existing humans) are living within a simulation created by a far-advanced post-human civilisation. In this scenario, our phenomenological world, indeed our internal world, has been meticulously created within our descendants’ über-computer. Bostrom, as well as <span class="citation annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner" data-cites="HANSON_HOW_LIVE_SIM" data-tippy-content="<p>Hanson 2001</p>">&bull;</span> points out that, owing to computational intractability, not all parts of the simulated world need be maintained at all times, rather elements of ‘reality’ can be generated only to the extent that some human is observing or encountering that element of the simulated world.</div></div>
<div data-v-fb2bae8a data-v-10799180><div data-v-fb2bae8a class="relative max-w-xl mx-auto mb-6">Rendering-upon-demand is something we find gaming engines doing now<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a>: they generate scenes as and when needed, i.e. when a player is focused on the objects in question, allowing the game engine to use its processing power and memory efficiently, and handle worlds that are much larger than if it tried to simulate ‘everything’, seen and unseen. Players in contemporary 3-D game-worlds usually expect physical laws to apply, i.e. balls should bounce, walls are usually hard, water is a fluid, fog licks into corners, etc. Therefore, the game engine often incorporates a physics engine that replicates the real world, at varying levels of fidelity: simple games may only handle macroscopic features such as balls and hard surfaces, while the most sophisticated model particle-based fluids such as fire and smoke.</div></div>
<div data-v-fb2bae8a data-v-10799180><div data-v-fb2bae8a class="relative max-w-xl mx-auto mb-6">But the physics is simulated only at a level-of-detail required to convince the viewer, which is something the creator needs to define. So rocks, buildings, streets, leaves, trees, waves, clouds are mostly produced as textures (tiny image files), that are cleverly replicated and mathematically transformed to create a compelling illusion. Some phenomena such as fire and smoke use physics, but again, in limited ways so as to not waste computation on things that don’t change the believability of the final image. For instance, no game, to my knowledge, simulates quantum-level physical phenomena, because that is irrelevant for players<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a>.</div></div>
<div data-v-fb2bae8a data-v-10799180><div data-v-fb2bae8a class="relative max-w-xl mx-auto mb-6">This leads to curious, perhaps unsatisfying, situations where objects are simply a hollow shell with infinitesmally-thick sheet walls, much like a cinema set or Potemkin Village<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a>. In other cases, like a mirage-in-reverse, forests that were amorphous, almost painterly expanses of sun-dappled green will visibly resolve themselves, as the player’s camera approaches, into individual leaves, branches and trunks<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a>. In a well-made game<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a>, perhaps these imperfections are crafted away (by rendering at the required level-of-detail well in advance of becoming visible to the player, for instance, or by not allowing the player to peer behind any under-implemented geometry). From the perspective of player expectations, it is plausible that human gamers understand these infidelities as a type of simplification, that allows the underlying logic and emotional content of the game to emerge, what Jesper Juul terms the ‘half-real’ <span class="citation annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner" data-cites="JUUL_2019" data-tippy-content="<p>Juul 2019</p>">&bull;</span>. However, in the WBE/AGI world, as Bostrom discusses, artificially-constructed environments and VR quite possibly would not just be entertainment, rather it <em>is</em> the reality that an emulation lives within. Moreover, they could be a mode of control for an emulation-based society: supervising agents could use VR environments to test lower-ranking agents on whatever criteria (trust, normative behaviour, etc.) <span class="citation annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner" data-cites="BOSTROM_2017" data-tippy-content="<p>Bostrom 2017, pp. 209, 250</p>">&bull;</span>. In such a control society, it seems reasonable that a lower-ranking agent will do everything possible to uncover flaws or deceptions in its VR, unlike Juul’s human player, who overlooks such imperfections<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a>.</div></div>

The fact that Microsoft’s games run on dedicated hardware makes this even more creepy: whereas a PC or smartphone <em>might</em> prevent such extensive surveillance (through system-wide privacy settings), the <em>raison d’etre</em> of the Xbox is to only play Microsoft games, hence if the user chooses not to accept Microsoft’s terms, that Xbox is ‘bricked’ (rendered useless).

As an aside, objecthood within games interacts with render-on-demand: in <em>No Man’s Sky</em> (2016), entire planets, and the plants, animals, and rocks on those planets are not created until required, raising some question as to <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/18/world-without-end-raffi-khatchadourian">whether they exist</a> in any sense at all.</div></div>

In many cases, game engine and the diverse devices communicate using HTTP calls and TCP/IP, the basic communication protocols of the Internet. Game engines also accommodate bots, written within the game environment or indeed brought in from the ‘outside’ via an API.

This isn’t to say they are simplistic or easily understandable - their behavioural logic, viewed by players from outside the game, can be full of surprises for the player and can certainly be made intentionally obscure.

<div data-v-fb2bae8a data-v-10799180><div data-v-fb2bae8a class="relative max-w-xl mx-auto mb-6">A convincing philosophical argument for the real-ness of digital, virtual worlds, albeit framed within a VR context, is made by David Chalmers <span class="citation annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner" data-cites="CHALMERS_2016" data-tippy-content="<p>Chalmers 2016</p>">&bull;</span> and a response from game theorist Jesper Juul <span class="citation annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner" data-cites="JUUL_2019" data-tippy-content="<p>Juul 2019</p>">&bull;</span>. However, both Chalmers and Juul focus primarily on the reality of virtual worlds, principally from the perspective of a human subject, rather than the inner experience, or relations between, objects within the virtual world. As such, their views seem to remain (albeit by construction) resolutely anthropocentric<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a>.</div></div>
<div data-v-fb2bae8a data-v-10799180><div data-v-fb2bae8a class="relative max-w-xl mx-auto mb-6">A more extreme metaphysical position is expressed in Graham Harman’s Object-Oriented Ontology (OOO), which is elaborated in a game context by Ian Bogost<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a>.

He undertakes an inter-objective rather than inter-subjective approach, focuses on the material mechanisms<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> of digital relations, and places time at the centre of relations <span class="citation annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner" data-cites="HUI_OBJECTS" data-tippy-content="<p>Hui 2016, p. 154, 175-182</p>">&bull;</span>. Specifically relevant here is his analysis of how the languages of the web have changed over the years to become more ‘machine-readable’ <span class="citation annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner" data-cites="HUI_OBJECTS" data-tippy-content="<p>Hui 2016, p. 62-73</p>">&bull;</span>. For instance, the early HTML<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> was a formatting language, legible to humans, that basically described what a webpage looks like. In subsequent years, specifications have evolved to include much more than formatting: the connective tissue of metadata<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> encapsulates information about content that other web platforms or softwares can interpret, and also make web objects ‘active’<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a>, in a way that is mostly transparent to the casual (non-programmer) user<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a>.</div></div>
<div data-v-fb2bae8a data-v-10799180><div data-v-fb2bae8a class="relative max-w-xl mx-auto mb-6">These shared ontologies and relations between digital objects can be found in games also. For instance, a leaf object contains formatting data such as its colour and texture, as well as normally static relational data such as what branch and tree it is attached to. However, its data structure also needs to account for the wind, such that it flutters in a breeze. Its texture map must change to reflect wetness when rained upon, and so forth. Hence the game engine must embed ‘dictionaries’ of translation and relation in the form of databases, further defining a specific ontology for digital (game) objects <span class="citation annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner" data-cites="HUI_OBJECTS" data-tippy-content="<p>Hui 2016, pp. 137-138</p>">&bull;</span>.

<div data-v-fb2bae8a data-v-10799180><div data-v-fb2bae8a class="relative max-w-xl mx-auto mb-6">One of the more visually compelling of Hanson’s predictions is this description of a city populated with emulations<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a>: ‘Such cities are very hot, even glowing, covered and pressurized, and arranged as a vast three-dimensional lattice, rather than as separate buildings, pulling winds of hot air into tall clouds overhead.’ <span class="citation annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner" data-cites="HANSON_2014" data-tippy-content="<p>Hanson 2014</p>">&bull;</span>. The tiny emulations, 7mm tall in Hanson’s prediction <span class="citation annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner" data-cites="HANSON_1994" data-tippy-content="<p>Hanson 1994</p>">&bull;</span>, are stacked at maximum density to minimise latency, supplied with power, network connections, cooling and any raw materials needed for repairs/modifications.</div></div>
<div data-v-fb2bae8a data-v-10799180><div data-v-fb2bae8a class="relative max-w-xl mx-auto mb-6">Hanson’s description recalls a J.G. Ballard short story, ‘The Concentration City’ (1957): it has been built up and interconnected at multiple levels, is covered and closed to the sky. Property, measured as cubic feet, is traded in real-time, and arson, both real and state-inflicted, is rife, in order to clear out space for high-rent businesses. People seem to live a credulous, soporific life under a regime of ubiquitous surveillance, with all the consequent neuroses one could expect in a panoptic society. The human protagonist fancies finding the countryside that surely must lie beyond the city limits. He boards an outbound train intending not to alight until the far terminus, only to find himself, after days of travelling, back at his origin point, the calendar reset to his departure date: time and space embedded in a Klein Bottle.</div></div>
<div data-v-fb2bae8a data-v-10799180><div data-v-fb2bae8a class="relative max-w-xl mx-auto mb-6">This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDTjw_P7sIU">Landian vision</a> may be extreme, but the ongoing lockdown is a reminder that (at least for the relatively well-off in a modestly technological society) one can do most tasks online, and even many physical interactions can be handled without going into the city. A city without restaurants, bars, cultural venues, that is inhospitable owing to heat, perhaps disease, perhaps civil unrest, can be given a wide berth.</div></div>
<div data-v-fb2bae8a data-v-10799180><div data-v-fb2bae8a class="relative max-w-xl mx-auto mb-6">Moreover, though cities can seem like vibrant, social zones built for people, they are interleaved with technological substructure. Consider New York City: data centres sited near high-frequency trading firms to shave off microseconds; <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/cloud-gaming-infrastructure-arms-race/">gaming servers</a> located strategically to minimise network latency; anonymous skyscrapers, chock-full of government surveillance equipment, house switching stations, continuously monitoring the <a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/06/25/att-internet-nsa-spy-hubs/">chokepoints</a> of modern telecommunications networks.</div></div>
<div data-v-fb2bae8a data-v-10799180><div data-v-fb2bae8a class="relative max-w-xl mx-auto mb-6">Yet the city, even emptied, may leave a mediated after-image: games, video streams, Zoom backgrounds. In a seemingly anthropocentric prediction<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a>, emulations would live in a lavishly and luxuriously rendered VR world (see <span class="citation annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner" data-cites="HANSON_2014" data-tippy-content="<p>Hanson 2014</p>">&bull;</span> and <span class="citation annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner" data-cites="BOSTROM_2017" data-tippy-content="<p>Bostrom 2017, p. 209</p>">&bull;</span>). The present, still getting to grips with immersive VR <span class="citation annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner" data-cites="BOWN_2018" data-tippy-content="<p>Bown 2018, pp. 86-90</p>">&bull;</span>, finds Pokémon Go’s Augmented Reality (AR) seamlessly blending game-space with urban space, via a <a href="https://roarmag.org/magazine/algorithmic-control-smartphone-internet-apps/">Google Maps API</a>. Tencent’s WeChat helpfully produces ‘heat maps’ that show crowd concentrations within cities, while feeding location data to the organs of state security for future digestion. London’s transport authority mulls a slightly less sinister vision of in-game rewards to ‘nudge’ Underground passengers towards less-crowded stations <span class="citation annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner" data-cites="BOWN_2018" data-tippy-content="<p>Bown 2018, p. 16</p>">&bull;</span>. Meanwhile the urban structures of the city become an armature for screens and CCTV: mounted atop buildings of glass and steel, we are treated to an excessively illuminated, continuous stream of Kardashian bottoms and CNBC ‘breaking news’, e.g. Times Square, central Tokyo, examples of Paul Virilio’s <a href="http://atributosurbanos.es/en/terms/overexposed-city/">‘Overexposed City’</a> (original essay <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/0t4/crcees/files/summerschool/readings/Virilio_2002_TheOverexposedCity.pdf">here</a>)....a grotesque funfair mirror of our smartphones.</div></div>

<div data-v-fb2bae8a data-v-10799180><div data-v-fb2bae8a class="relative max-w-xl mx-auto mb-6">This essay has tried to unpick what a future dominated by AGI might look like, particularly based on the work at Oxford’s FHI. It has had a specific angle, namely that an entertainment apparatus, for instance a game engine<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a>, will become critical as a surveillance and control tool, but also as a primary portal in which humans, increasingly automated out of employment, spend time. The online/offline hybrid character of this apparatus seems to fit into the Stack metaphor articulated by Bratton, who adopts a significant geopolitical slant, specifically, an engagement with Carl Schmitt. In this context, the rise, and increasing assertiveness of China, characterised by a cohesive ideological, control and technological strategy, is interesting. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) theoreticians have long had a curious fascination with <a href="https://palladiummag.com/2020/02/05/jiang-shigongs-vision-of-a-new-chinese-world-order/">Carl Schmitt</a><span class="citation annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner" data-cites="MITCHELL_2020" data-tippy-content="<p>For a more historical view, see [Mitchell 2020], whose thought has been used to justify China’s contemporary internal political arrangements, but also an external posture reminiscent of a <a href='https://palladiummag.com/2020/07/08/the-theory-of-history-that-guides-xi-jinping/''>benevolent hegemon</a>">&bull;</span>.</div></div>
<div data-v-fb2bae8a data-v-10799180><div data-v-fb2bae8a class="relative max-w-xl mx-auto mb-6">Hence, to end on another speculative scenario, again from Bostrom: the notion of a singleton <span class="citation annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner" data-cites="BOSTROM_2017" data-tippy-content="<p>Bostrom 2017, pp. 106-9, 216-25</p>">&bull;</span> as a possible outcome for global governance, that becomes necessary to handle global challenges such as climate change, pandemic resistance, or nuclear disarmament. The singleton could be (a) a benign ‘world government’ (an appropriately constituted UN, as proposed by the U.S. post-1945); (b) a takeover by one state (which could espouse nominally ‘liberal’ i.e. Western views, or have a radically different world-view i.e. China under the CCP); or (c) an AGI, which may or may not be <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ToNNGwqNS5kecZaNQ/elites-and-ai-stated-opinions">human-friendly</a>.</div></div>

    <li id="fn1"><p>Aspects of the FHI’s research, that loosely come under the term ‘transhumanism’ or the more definitionally problematic ‘posthumanism’, attract considerable criticism, for instance in this <a href="https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/in-optimism-lies-urgency-toby-ord-future-humanity/">review</a> of a book by FHI Fellow Toby Ord, or in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNJPR78DptA">talk</a> and paper <span class="citation annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner" data-cites="BRAIDOTTI_2018" data-tippy-content="<p>Braidotti 2018</p>">&bull;</span> by theorist Rosi Braidotti, the latter interesting for its broad survey of currents in critical posthumanist thought. Some of the criticism seems to revolve around an (alleged) arrogation of a singular, privleged ‘we’ or ‘human’ position, without acknowledging the gender and race differences that are central to post-1968 post-colonial, social and cultural theory. There is also a potential perception of quasi-eugenicism that might stem from Hanson’s prediction that the first emulation(s) will be based on real humans specifically chosen for certain criteria, such as intelligence, health or docility<span class="citation annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner" data-cites="BOSTROM_2017" data-tippy-content="<p>Bostrom 2017</p>">&bull;</span>, pp. 297-299). A slightly more balanced, philosophical view, on the issues surrounding evaluation of AGI from the our current state as mostly-biological humans can be found in <span class="citation annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner" data-cites="NEGARESTANI_2018" data-tippy-content="<p>Negarestani 2018</p>">&bull;</span>, pp. 95-98, as well as in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Posthuman-Life-Philosophy-Edge-Human/dp/1844658066">David Roden’s</a> book. Lastly, an elegant summary of the varieties of ‘humanisms’ can be found in <span class="citation annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner" data-cites="HUI_2019" data-tippy-content="<p>Hui 2019</p>">&bull;</span>, pp. 245-247.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>

The search for AGI, albeit for contested reasons, appears to be stuck, perhaps missing some <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/how-close-are-we-to-creating-artificial-intelligence">philosophical</a> or algorithmic insight, or simply lacking the <a href="https://www.kurzweilai.net/the-real-reasons-we-dont-have-agi-yet">computing power</a>. The theory is that WBE is a more achievable intermediate goal, because it does not rely on any major algorithmic hurdle, and once sufficient agents are available that function at near-human or super-human levels, across a broad range of tasks, these agents can try to work out a successful approach to ‘true’ AGI. <span class="citation annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner" data-cites="BOSTROM_2017" data-tippy-content="<p>Bostrom 2017</p>">&bull;</span>, pp. 291-293, 297-313, also sketches out the various dynamics of the path laid out above, control issues, and ethical-political considerations.<a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>

Sapience also allows us to bootstrap: to construct hypotheses, test them, and use the results of these tests to create theories or heuristics, which are in turn, added into our store of concepts which we can subsequently use to reason.

After the initial upload, these same emulations, or further clones of them, might engage in a process of recursive self-improvement where they choose to leave behind such detritus of their human ancestors, or indeed, may choose to retain these artefacts. The word ‘choose’ is used loosely, as decisions on values and perspectives are bound up with the initial coding of the emulation’s values so as to remain aligned with certain human norms, as extensively discussed in <span class="citation annotation-counter annotation-counter-inner" data-cites="BOSTROM_2017" data-tippy-content="<p>Bostrom 2017</p>">&bull;</span>, pp. 226-253.<a href="#fnref42" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>

For instance, high-level languages (LISP, C++, Java, Processing, Haskell, etc.) are compiled/interpreted down to assembly language, which is much closer to the ‘native code’ of a microprocessor. Operating systems routinely use virtual machines: Windows emulators running on OS X, Linux on Windows, etc.<a href="#fnref45" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>

At a more banal level, technological issues such as network latency can cause games to <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/cloud-gaming-infrastructure-arms-race/">stutter</a>, much as a video download pauses unexpectedly.<a href="#fnref47" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
